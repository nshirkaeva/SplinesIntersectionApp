# SplinesIntersectionApp
C++ code for computing the intersection of two BÃ©zier spline curves of arbitrary dimensions(2, 3, 4.. points) in the X0Y plane.
The class can be initialized with 2d-type point(x,y)
 
CrossSection uses an efficient recursive approach based on the binary tree (r-tree) traversal algorithm to compute the position on the curve.
